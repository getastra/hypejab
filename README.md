# HypeJab ðŸ’‰

HypeJab serves as a purposeful target for evaluating the effectiveness of automated scanners, designed specifically to exploit its vulnerabilities. This web application is intentionally crafted to highlight common security flaws found in online systems. By offering a controlled environment for scanning tools to assess their accuracy and efficiency, HypeJab facilitates the benchmarking process. Its deliberate vulnerabilities include weak authentication mechanisms, flawed input validation, and potential cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection vulnerabilities. The primary goal of HypeJab is to aid in the improvement of automated scanners, enabling developers to enhance their ability to detect and mitigate web application vulnerabilities effectively.

## Usage

#### Local Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ricekot/hypejab.git
cd hypejab
docker-compose up
```

#### K8s deployment
- create a name space name `hypejab`
- Create nginx docker image using 
  ```bash
  docker build -f Dockerfile.nginx . -t <image name>:<image tag>
  ```
- Create php micro service docker image using 
  ```bash
  docker build -f Dockerfile . -t <image name>:<image tag>
  ```
- Replace the name of `<nginx image name>` and `<php image name>` in the `k8s-support/hypejab.yaml` file.
- Apply 
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f k8s-support/hypejab.yaml
  ```

**Note**
```
 As Hypejab is an intentionally vulnerable microservice, k8s-support/np.yaml file provides network policy that restricts any egress network from the pod for the security of other resources deployed in the cluster.
